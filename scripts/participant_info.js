  <h4>What is this study about?</h4>
  <p>You are invited to take part in a research study investigating how cognitive and individual differences factors influence our ability to act or withhold actions when needed.</p>
  <p>You have been invited to participate in this study because you have expressed interest through the first- and second-year psychology participant pool (SONA). This Participant Information Statement tells you about the research study. Knowing what is involved will help you decide if you want to take part. Please read carefully and ask questions if anything is unclear.</p>
  <p><strong>Participation is voluntary.</strong></p>
  <p>By giving consent you are telling us that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand what you have read.</li>
    <li>Agree to take part in the research study as outlined below.</li>
    <li>Agree to the use of your personal information as described.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You will be emailed a copy of this Participant Information Statement to keep.</p>

  <p>The study is being carried out by: Prof. Evan Livesey, Dr. Dominic Tran, Dr. Yvonne Chan, Dr. Justine Greenaway, Illeana Prieto, Athena Cheng, Brendon Popovski, Jack Collins, and Andrew Huang.</p>

  <h4>Who can take part in the study?</h4>
  <p>The study is open to all who may be interested.</p>

  <h4>What will the study involve for me?</h4>
  <p>During the experiment, you will be asked to view and respond to visual stimuli on a computer screen. Depending on the version of the experiment, the stimuli may be shapes, objects, faces, words, letters, or other symbols. You may be asked to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify a stimulus,</li>
    <li>Judge its orientation, location, or motion direction,</li>
    <li>Respond to its appearance using button presses,</li>
    <li>Use memory and problem-solving abilities,</li>
    <li>Answer a questionnaire about daily habits.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The study should take approximately 60 minutes. If you complete it seriously and finish earlier, you will still receive full credit. Please do not share details of the study with others, to avoid biasing their responses.</p>

  <h4>Can I withdraw once I have started?</h4>
  <p>Participation is voluntary. Your decision will not affect your relationship with the researchers or the University of Sydney. You may withdraw at any time before the experiment ends by informing the researcher. Starting and submitting your final response indicates your consent.</p>
  <p>If you withdraw before finishing, no data will be recorded. If you withdraw during the task, you may request that previously collected data be removed. After the final question is submitted, data cannot be withdrawn as it is stored anonymously.</p>

  <h4>Are there any risks or costs?</h4>
  <p>Aside from giving up your time, we do not expect any risks or costs from participating.</p>

  <h4>Are there any benefits?</h4>
  <p>We cannot guarantee direct benefits, but you will help us understand factors that lead to errors and how they can be minimised. You may also learn more about psychological research. You will receive 1 course credit for your participation.</p>

  <h4>What will happen to information that is collected?</h4>
  <p>By consenting, you agree that your experimental responses will be collected for research. Data will only be used for purposes outlined here, unless you provide further consent.</p>
  <p>Your information will be stored securely and de-identified. Your personal sign-up details will remain confidential. Results may be published in aggregate form but you will not be identifiable.</p>
  <p>We may use anonymised data for future projects, subject to ethical approval.</p>

  <h4>Will I be told the results?</h4>
  <p>You may request feedback on the overall results. Contact the researcher who conducted your experiment or posted the advertisement. Feedback will be provided after the study in the form of a brief written summary and a captioned figure with aggregate data.</p>

  <h4>What if I would like more information?</h4>
  <p>You can contact the relevant researcher for more information. Researchers include: Prof. Evan Livesey, Dr. Dominic Tran, Dr. Yvonne Chan, Dr. Justine Greenaway, Illeana Prieto, Athena Cheng, Brendon Popovski, Jack Collins, and Andrew Huang.</p>
