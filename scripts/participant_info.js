  <h1>Participant Information Sheet</h1>
  <h2 style="color: #e1310e;"> ETH23-8006 - G-16-2025 - Impulsivity and Daily Habits</h2>

  <h4>WHO IS CONDUCTING THIS RESEARCH?</h4>
  Our names are Shao-hsuan Huang and Ruhi Kumar and we are students at UTS. Our supervisor is Dominic Tran.

  <h4>WHAT IS THE RESEARCH ABOUT?</h4>
  This online research aims to investigate the relationship between impulsivity and daily social media habits among university students and assess whether a correlation is present between a new task developed for testing response inhibition and a pre-existing response inhibition task.

  <h4>WHY HAVE I BEEN INVITED?</h4>
  You have been invited to participate because you are part of the target population for this study. Specifically, you meet the eligibility criteria, such as being within the appropriate age range and currently enrolled in a psychology subject at UTS.

  <strong>Inclusion criteria:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Students enrolled in psychology courses at the University of Technology Sydney</li>
    <li>17 years or older</li>
    <li>Fluent in English (to understand task instructions and questionnaire items)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>WHAT DOES MY PARTICIPATION INVOLVE?</h4>
  Participation in this study is voluntary. It is completely up to you whether or not you decide to take part. If you decide to participate, we will invite you to:
  <ul>
    <li>Complete an online experiment (including behavioural tasks and self-report measures) which takes around 60 minutes.</li>
    <li>Read all the instructions carefully and answer all the questions as honestly and accurately as possible.</li>
    <li>Try not to let your performance/answers on one behavioural task/statement influence your responses to others.</li>
  </ul>
  Participation is expected to take 60 minutes and you will receive <strong>2 SONA credits</strong>.

  <h4>ARE THERE ANY RISKS/INCONVENIENCE?</h4>
  Although we do not anticipate any risks or discomfort from the behavioural tasks, the social media addiction questionnaire may prompt you to reflect on your social media use and recognise potential negative impacts. 

  Please be aware that you have the right to refuse to answer any questions, and you are free to discontinue participation at any time without giving any reason and without any consequences.

  If you experience distress, please contact your GP or UTS Counselling (9514 1177).
